* Git-game
[[https://github.com/hgarc014/git-game]]

A simple game to test your git skills. Of course, the game ifself is distributed
in git. It is really simple -- not a challenge.

** Pros
- KISS and well written
- you can learn something if you're a git newbie, and probably will find it fun
  if you're already used to git

** Cons
- not really a tutorial
- you can fast-forward the game by early checking out to branches you're not supposed to
